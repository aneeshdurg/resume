    <ul>
      <li> Static analysis tool for <b>C/C++</b> to reject semantically invalid callgraphs, powered by <b>clang</b> and <b>Cypher</b> </li>
      <li>
        Provides an ergonomic way for users to label functions and lambdas and to define relationships between those labels that should be considered invalid. Some example usecases are:
        <ul>
          <li> Prevent functions that assume locks are held from being called without a lock </li>
          <li> Prevent functions using collective <b>MPI</b> operations from being called during another collective operation </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
