    <ul>
      <li> Arbitrary compile-time function coloring and callgraph rejection tool powered by <b>clang</b> and <b>Cypher</b> </li>
      <li>
        Provides an ergonomic way for users to labels functions and lambdas, and then define relationships between those labels that should be considered invalid. Some example usecases are:
        <ul>
          <li> label functions that assume locks are held to verify that they are never called without a lock </li>
          <li> label routines using collective <b>MPI</b> operations to ensure that other collective operations aren't called during execution </li>
          <li> prevent secure functions from being called from insecure contexts </li>
          <li> prototype new language features such as async/constexpr without writing custom compiler passes/extensions </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
