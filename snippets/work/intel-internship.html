    <ul>
      <li> Evaluated performance of <b> Intel Movidius Neural Compute stick (NCS) </b>. </li>
      <li> Proposed and built a tool to split large networks across multiple <b>NCS</b> devices </li>
      <li> Developed a browser plugin to demonstrate real-time image recognition on Raspberry PIs using <b>NCS</b>.
      <li> Developed a benchmarking suite to demonstrate a 1.5x speedup on <b>CNNs</b>  (<b>GoogLeNet</b>, <b>AlexNet</b>, <b>Age-Gender Net</b>) by using <b>NCS</b>. Compared against CPU/GPU using <b>Caffe</b>. </li>
      <li>  Made a proof of concept demonstrating potential performance gains by parallelizing NCS convolution. </li>
      <li> Improved performance of <b>libSVM</b> on intel CPUs by using <b>OpenMP</b> for parallelism and <b>MKL</b> BLAS libraries to use intel CPU specific BLAS instructions. Achieved a 4x speed on the "Up squared" development board (Apollo Lake SoC). </li>
